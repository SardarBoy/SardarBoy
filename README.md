### 🌱 October 2025 — The Start of Something

It’s already October 22nd, and I’ve finally decided to just start.  
I’ve actually begun a bit already — will try to upload that soon.  
Right now, I’m revisiting **PySpark** (worked on it during my Accenture project), brushing up **scikit-learn**, started **Neetcode DSA leetcode** sheet and planning to get hands-on with **PyTorch**.  
Just trying to stay consistent, learn every day, and document the journey as I go.
